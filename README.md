# How to make this work on your system 🧑‍💻🧑‍💻
- Fork this repository.
- Create an empty folder on your device.
- Open a text editor (preferably VSCode) with its directory being the empty folder.
- Create a python virtual environment (env).

    > `virtualenv env`
- Activate the virtual environment.

    > `env\Scripts\activate`    (for Windows users)
    
    > `source env/bin/activate`     (for macOS users)
- Clone the forked repository to the folder where the virtual environment is active.
- Install the pip packages stated at `requirements.txt`.
    > `pip install -r requirements.txt`

- Install all npm packages using this simple command.
    > `npm install`

- Run the Frontend.
    > `npm run dev`

- Then finally run the Backend.
    > `python manage.py runserver`

    You made it !! 😁😁, well that was easy 😅😅. Feel free to work on this.

Note also: The User app is the main web application. The Note markdown for navigation would be released soon.
